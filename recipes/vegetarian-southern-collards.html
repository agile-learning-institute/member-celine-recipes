    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>
    This recipe is a vegetarian take on the classic southern meat-seasoned dish. 
    You won't find yourself missing the meat flavor as it is seasoned in a way that adds
    so much more depth and flavor. The collards will melt in your mouth and make you wish you 
    could live on vinegear and greens.

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 diced white onion</li>
            <li>1 quart of veggie broth</li>
            <li>32 oz of chopped collards</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>Spices: Salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, cajun seasoning, onion powder
                and smoked garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 gloves of diced garlic</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil on medium heat in a large stock pot, then add the diced onion. Cook until
                slightly charred, then add the diced garlic.</li>
            <li>Add the veggie broth and spices then bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the collards, cover, then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 hours.
                45 minutes is the minimum, but the longer, the more flavor will be unleashed.</li>
            <li>Add the apple cider vingear and adjust the spices as necessary.</li>
        </ol>
